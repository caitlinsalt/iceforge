Hello World
-----------

This is an Iceforge site.

This is probably something approaching the bare minimum "useful" Iceforge site.  It includes:

- A config file, `config.json`, which only contains the site title.
- A template file, which is less than ten lines long.
- A Markdown file, with a couple of lines of metadata added.

And this is the result, a single HTML file.

You'll probably want to do a lot more.  And you *can* do a lot more.  But this is your basic starting point.
